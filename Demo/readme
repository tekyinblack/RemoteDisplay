Demonstration and example program for the ESPNOWdisplay unit

This has two operational actions, one is to perform a basic lightshow display on the
display unit. The second action is to read the temperature and humidity from a DHT11/22
module and display this on the display unit as a practical application.

The two modes alternate roughly 30 seconds of practical display, 10 seconds of light show
A video of the operation is on the instructables website article with a roughly 10/5 second
split.

This program has to be loaded onto an ESP01/DHT11/22 module running Micropython and modified to 
include the MAC address of the display module. The MAC address can be obtained by running the
mac.py utilty on the display unit before installing the unit in its case. It is recommended that
the MAC address is recorded and attached to the display unit case with a label for future 
easy reference
