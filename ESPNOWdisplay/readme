# This code is intended to run on an ESP-01 / ESP8266 / ESP32 loaded with Micropython
# The purpose is to receive illumination information from another Espressif controller
# over ESP-NOW and use that to control a WS2812b RGB LED string
#
# Information to build the complete unit is published on the instructables website here
# https://www.instructables.com/Remote-WS2812b-LED-Display-for-Control-Over-ESP-NO/
#
# This is still in development and does not handle exceptions.
# Exception handling will be added after a period of testing
