# RemoteDisplay
Python code for ESP32/8266 remote display project

There are two components, Display/receiver and source/transmitter, communication being over ESP-NOW
Using this facility there can be multiple displays and multiple information sources

The basic demo uses the DHT11/22, of the shelf module, to send temperature and humidity display information

The display unit only operates via remote control and doesn't create displays itself

A full description of assembling a unit is published on the instructables website here
