# RemoteDisplay
Python code for ESP32/8266 remote display project

There are two components, Display/receiver and source/transmitter

The basic demo uses the DHT11/22 of the shelf module to send temperature and humidity display information

The display unit only operates via remote control and doesn't create displays itself
